# dare-toolbox

JavaScript GameDev Toolbox for game jams.

*Created Specially for LudumDare 36 during pre-jam warm up.*

I would prefer to use this simple toolbox instead of
a full-blown JS game engine,
since engines has failed me multiple times before.

## Deprecated!

This project is no longer active and is not supported.

*Use [Collider.JAM](https://github.com/invider/collider.jam) instead!*

It builds up on a dare-toolbox foundation
and provides a much more robust and convenient
game framework for game development, jamming, prototyping,
creative coding and beyond.
