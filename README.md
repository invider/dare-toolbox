JavaScript Game Toolbox for LudumDare

Created Specially for LudumDare 36 during warm up.

I would prefer to use this simple toolbox instead of
a full-blown JS game engine,
because engines failed me multiple times in previous jams.

## Deprecated!

This project is not activelly developed or supported.

Use [Collider.JAM](https://github.com/invider/collider.jam) instead.
It builds up on dare-toolbox foundation
and provides much more robust and convenient
game framework for jamming, hackatons and prototyping.
